This repository contains some examples for the NFCTools for Java:
https://github.com/grundid/nfctools

ClearCardDemo will try to delete all data on a Mifare Classic card and put the card back into transport mode. It will
use some known keys to access the sectors.

NdefReaderDemo reads an NDEF message from a Mifare Classic card and shows it in the log.

NdefWriterDemo writes an NDEF message on a Mifare Classic card.

ScanWholeCardDemo scans the whole Mifare Classic card and shows the contents in the log.

LlcpService demonstrates a P2P connection with an Android phone. It will receive any Android Beam and NDEF Push
messages and show them in the log.
With Android 2.3 please set initiatorMode to false, with Android 4+ it works best in initiatorMode set to true.
